**War_Thunder_Data_Scraper**
==========================

### Project Title
A dedicated data scraper for War Thunder, designed to fetch and process relevant in-game information.

### Description
As a passionate gamer and developer, I built this to satisfy my curiosity about War Thunder's vast game universe. The War_Thunder_Data_Scraper project utilizes Python's Scrapy framework to extract valuable data from the game's website, such as tank stats, battle records, and more!

One cool feature is... **customizable scraping**: You can easily add or modify spider configurations to target specific types of data, making it a versatile tool for any War Thunder enthusiast.

### Features
* **Multi-threaded data extraction**: Leverage the power of multiple threads to scrape data concurrently.
* **Data processing and storage**: Utilize SQL database integration for efficient data storage and querying.
* **Easy configuration**: Modify spider settings with minimal coding effort, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.
